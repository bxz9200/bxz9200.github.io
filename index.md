# About Me
<div style="text-align: justify">My name is **Bingyin Zhao**. I am a **<font color=LigthSykBlue>Research Fellow</font>** at the **<font color=Darkorange>National University of Singapore</font>**, working with <a href="[url]([https://laogroup.ece.tufts.edu/](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/biplab-sikdar/))">Dr. Biplab Sikdar</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from **<font color=Darkorange>Clemson University</font>** in the United States under the supervision of <a href="[url](https://laogroup.ece.tufts.edu/)">Dr. Yingjie Lao</a>.</div>



<div style="text-align: justify">I worked as a **<font color=LigthSykBlue>Deep Learning Software and Research Intern</font>** at <font color="DarkGreen">NVIDIA<font> under the supervision of [Dr. Jose M. Alvarez](https://alvarezlopezjosem.github.io/) and [Dr. Zhiding Yu](https://chrisding.github.io/). I received a full-time offer as a **<font color=LigthSykBlue>Senior System Software Engineer</font>** from **<font color=Green>NVIDIA</font>** after the internship but could not return to the U.S. due to an unexpected visa issue. I then relocated to Singapore. Thank you Singapore for having me and I love this place!</div>



<div style="text-align: justify">My research interests include Generative AI, Trustworthy AI and Computer Vision. I have authored and co-authored several research papers, which have been accepted and published in prestigious conferences and journals, including **<font color=OrangeRed>ICCV'23</font>**, **<font color=OrangeRed>AAAI'22</font>**, **<font color=OrangeRed>IEEE TCAD</font>**, **<font color=OrangeRed>DAC'23</font>**, **<font color=OrangeRed>WACV'22</font>**, etc. I also serve as a reviewer for multiple computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, etc.</div>
